This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, this project runs optimally with pnpm, so run: 

npm install -g pnpm

Make sure next is installed: 

pnpm install next 

For next to properly run, make sure you node version greater than 18.18

Make sure you have mongo installed:

pnpm install mongodb

Then, make sure to create a .env file and create a variable that holds mongodb uri called MONGODB_URI. Here's an example:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@testcluster.abc123.mongodb.net/

Finally, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
